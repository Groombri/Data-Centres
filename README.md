From September to December 2025, I worked for the Pentland Centre for Sustainability in Business as a research assistant. This involved carrying out a pre-study relating to data centre locations and resource consumption. The final report includes a literature review and all the work I carried out. One task was to try and find publicly available data that can be used to identify data centres and estimate their resource consumption, as the industry is extremely secretive. The main bulk of code in this repo relates to the querying and mapping of said data. This successfully identified a significant number of UK data centres from publicly-available data, which was used to create our own map, similair to that of DataCenterMap.com, and that can be used for geospatial analysis.
